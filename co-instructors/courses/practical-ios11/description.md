iPhone Development Course

What’s New in IOS 11, Swift 4 and Xcode 9



In this course you are going to learn some of the new features added to iOS 11 and Xcode 9. We are going to create multiple apps that focus on each of the new features. Some of these new features include;



New Xcode Features



Xcode has lots of new features and we’ll be taking a look at some of the new exciting features and how to take advantage of them to make you a better coder. These features include structure highlighting, method extraction, easy renaming, github integration etc.



ARKit



Artificial Reality app used to take thousands of lines of code and complex algorithm to achieve but with the new iOS 11 ARkit, it takes only few lines of code to make an AR app.

Machine Learning



Machine learning is gaining traction in the computer industry and there’s no better time to learn machine learning and how to develop an app that take advantage of it. We’ll develop a simple app that can recognise dominant object in a photo and an app that can recognise the faces of the people in a photo



Drag and Drop



iOS 11 allows user to drag and drop content within one app and also between two different apps. We’ll develop a basic app that allows dragging text from one part to another part.



Vision



We’ll develop an app that allows you to track real world object directly through your phone’s camera. This is a nice feature.



Many more.



We’ll be diving into Natural Language Processing, SiriKit, PDFKit, Apple Music integration, new camera APIs, new Files app and so on…



Now’s the best time to learn iOS 11, Swift 4 and Xcode now before the official release of the public version to the users.
