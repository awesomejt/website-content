The Maven Quick Start course is designed to cut academic theory to just the key concepts and focus on basics tasks in Maven in order to be productive quickly. The lessons and examples provided are delivered in a step-by-step, detailed way to ensure mastery of the skills and topics covered.

Course Outline

Introduction walks through the course goals, approach and the core concepts of Maven.

After that, we breeze through installation of all required tools in the Quick Installation section. The full step-by-step installation process is available in the Bonus sections.

In Setup and Getting Help, we cover how to ask for help in Maven. We also download the course working files on GitHub.

With the formalities out of the way, we dive into a Maven Quick Start By Example, walking the foundational aspects of Maven using a sample application.

After the basics are covered, we explore Maven Plugins in more detail by customizing our project using them.

One of the key aspects of Maven, is how it handles Dependencies. We go deeper by adding dependencies from Maven Central and explore the role of scopes with dependencies in Maven.

Then we improve our project by Unit Testing -- where we add JUnit tests, deal with (and avoid) testing failures. Finally, the last section of the main part of this course is dedicated to running Maven within Eclipse using the M2Eclipse plugin.

Finally, we will look at Using Archetypes to jump start Maven projects by using a template system.

During the entire course, we get into a habit of saving our changes periodically using Git source control.

Course Features

Presentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.

Over 2 hours of Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated.

Project files and examples are all available on GitHub.
