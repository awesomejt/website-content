# template for each commit

## Question

 Is it possible to create a template for each commit into git repository, and to send invitation to fellow developers for review on that particular commit using only github?


## Answer

Setup a __README.md__ file at the root of your project on GitHub. GitHub will render the _markdown_ file, in which you can provide instructions to developers on the project. Encourage them to __fork__ the repository and submit _pull requests_ to contribute.
